**Project Report: Phishing Attack Simulation Using Stormbreaker**

## **1. Introduction**
Phishing attacks are among the most common cyber threats, exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive tactics. This project aims to demonstrate the risks associated with phishing and social engineering techniques using the **Stormbreaker** tool, in combination with **Ngrok** and **Zphisher**. The objective is to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats and educate users on how to identify and mitigate such attacks.

## **2. Objectives**
- To simulate real-world phishing attacks for cybersecurity awareness.
- To demonstrate how attackers exploit social engineering vulnerabilities.
- To analyze the risks associated with unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- To educate individuals and organizations on cybersecurity best practices.

## **3. Methodology**
The project involved setting up a controlled phishing attack simulation using open-source tools. The following steps were undertaken:
1. **Setup of Stormbreaker** – Installed and configured Stormbreaker to capture device details (IP, OS, browser, etc.), location, camera, and microphone access.
2. **Integration with Ngrok** – Used Ngrok to create publicly accessible tunnels for testing attack scenarios.
3. **Phishing Simulation with Zphisher** – Used Zphisher to generate fake login pages for credential harvesting.
4. **Analysis of Collected Data** – Examined the types of information obtained and their potential security risks.
5. **Documentation and Awareness** – Prepared guidelines on preventing phishing attacks and recognizing social engineering tactics.

## **4. Tools Used**
- **Stormbreaker** – For information gathering through phishing tactics.
- **Ngrok** – To expose local servers to the internet securely.
- **Zphisher** – To create phishing web pages for awareness.
- **Linux Terminal** – For executing commands and running scripts.

## **5. Results and Findings**
The phishing simulation successfully demonstrated the ease with which attackers can obtain sensitive user data. The key findings include:
- Users often click on unknown links without verifying their authenticity.
- Many users unknowingly grant access to camera and location services.
- Social engineering remains a major cybersecurity threat due to human error.

## **6. Ethical Considerations**
This project was conducted strictly for ethical and educational purposes. The following guidelines were followed:
- No real user data was exploited or misused.
- All experiments were conducted in a controlled environment.
- The project emphasizes cybersecurity awareness rather than exploitation.

## **7. Conclusion and Future Scope**
This project highlights the importance of cybersecurity awareness and the need for improved security measures. Future enhancements could include:
- Implementing advanced phishing detection mechanisms.
- Conducting awareness campaigns on social engineering threats.
- Exploring AI-based solutions for phishing prevention.
